      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="content-page">
      In 2020, there is a serious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak around the world, in which more than 1.36M people have been infected and nearly 76K people die from this disease, based on <a href = "https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"> the statistics from Johns Hopkins University </a> (last accessed: 7th April, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) has deemed COVID-19 a pandemic. To provide the first-hand information for the general public, many web-based visualization systems have been developed for visualizing the distribution / statistics of COVID-19 cases. However, these systems either cannot provide high visualization quality or cannot support interactive visualization operations (e.g., zoom in and panning operations). Kernel density visualization (KDV) is a solution to offer high visualization quality (for hot spot analysis) but its computational cost limits its usability. Here, we develop the first near real-time interactive visualization tool IKDV-SYS that is built on top of our prior study [1] on the efficient kernel density computation.
      </p>
      <h2>IKDV-SYS</h2>
	  <p class="content-page">
	  <!--This system can support different types of interactive visualization operations, e.g., zoom-in, panning etc, in nearly real-time for multiple users.-->
      IKDV-SYS can be used to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases (based on heatmap) in the world. Compared with the state-of-the-art geographical software, e.g., <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_heatmap.html">QGIS</a> and <a href="https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/spatial-analyst-toolbox/kernel-density.htm">ArcGIS</a>, IKDV-SYS is the first web-based system, which can support:
	  </br>
	  <b>(1) the near real-time kernel density visualization in single machine setting without using GPU and parallel computation</b>
	  </br>
	  <b>(2) different types of interactive visualization operations, e.g., zoom-in, panning etc, in near real-time</b>
	  </br>
	  
	  We have released our <a href = "http://degroup.cis.um.edu.mo/covid-19/">system</a> (1<sup>st</sup> version) to the general public. However, this is only the prototype in which we still need to refine it as better as possible. As such, we <b>disclaim any liability</b> in connection with the use of this system. In addition, since we cannot obtain the precise dataset for representing the COVID-19 cases, due to the privacy issue. The visualization in the city/street level is not accurate. Our demo paper is under submission to VLDB2020 (demo track) [2]. Hope that this paper can be accepted in this conference.
